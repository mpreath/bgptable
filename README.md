bgptable is a small set of Python scripts that scrapes the BGP4 and BGP6 table sizes from the @bgp4_table and @bgp6_table Twitter feeds. It stores the last 365 days of data into a sqlite database file and provides some analytical information regarding the data. It also can post graphs to a Twitter feed.
